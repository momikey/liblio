# Liblio - a federated platform to connect creators and their audiences

This project is very much a work in progress at present. Check the roadmap below for what's done and what I'm still working on.

## Installation

(TODO)

## Roadmap

All of these are subject to change, and I'll likely add to them as I go.

### Beta 1

These are the bare minimum tasks that need to be finished before Liblio can be considered beta software.

#### Front end

* Personal timeline
* Notifications
* Profile page
* Profile settings
* Avatars
* Tagging
* Explorers (These are mostly done, but need more polish.)
* Admin panel
* Site settings (I need to study what kinds of settings Liblio should have.)
* Full i18n (Swap out `labels` objects for proper vue-i18n support.)

#### Back end

* Site settings (This is actually implementing them on the server side.)
* Remember Me
* Rate limiting for some API endpoints

#### Other

* Installation documentation
* A full suite of tests (unit, integration, etc.)

### Release 1.0

These items are necessary for me to feel comfortable releasing a 1.0 version of Liblio.

* Full federation through ActivityPub (and possibly other networks)
* Multiple localizations
* Theme support
* Easy installer
